Design Notes

Should this be a UInt package? Or something like BinaryArray instead.
- Not really intended for doing maths.
- Only mathmatical operations needed for target project
  are x == 0 or x > 0; Could simplify to IsZero and cut out
  a lot of noise.
- Need a "left to right" view rather than most / least significant
  view on the binary. ie, each bit is of equal significance.


ArbitraryUint
Wrapper class for array of 64bit uints.
- Fixed size once created

create(size: number, chunkSize: 8|16|32|64) = 32;
createFromTypedArray(arr: TypedArray, chunkSize: 8|16|32|64) = 32);

// Setting Values
getSetBitFunctions(setDirection = Left | Right);
setBit(target: ArbitraryUint, offset, val, from = Left | Right == Left);
SetBits(start, val);

// Bitwise operations
and(...x: AribtraryUint)
or(...x: AribtraryUint)
xor(...x: AribtraryUint)

// Comparisons. Ergonomics is tricky here.
// subject, target is easier to read.
// target, subject is easier for currying.
Equal
NotEqual
GreaterThan
LessThan
GreaterThanOrEqual
LessThanOrEqual

opName(subject, comparison); // subject op compareTo
equal(no1, no2)
greaterThan(no1, no2) // is no1 greater than no2

// Fast vs Slow operands
If we know ahead of time that we are using
fixed size and fixed chunkSize Uints, we can 
do bitwise and comparison operations much more
quickly because we will be omitting size 
and chunkType checks and coalescing.

For instance, when we don't have this info,
we need to check:
- Same size
- Same chunk size
- If either don't match, we need to pad. Doing
  so increases cpu cycles and memory usage.
